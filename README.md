# Incident Classification Prediction Of Location and Casualties
- This project was done for the competition named **MILBOTICS 2k19** (September,2019 - January,2020) conducted by College of Military Engineering,Pune,Maharashtra,India. 
- The problem statement given to all 35 teams was **AI : Trend Analysis and Deductions of Anti-National Elements** where the judges were expecting code output + presentation from all the teams.
- I alongwith my teammates,[Pratik Kale](https://github.com/pkale32) and Sarun, decided to use Random Forest Regressor & ARIMA model in combination to predict location & number of casualties respectively which triumphed over the other 34 teams.
- We presented our work at **2021 8th International Conference on Computing for Sustainable Global Development (INDIACom)** which is published in [IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9441087).

## File Descriptions :
- **Data** : It contains csv files which are used throughout the project for different purposes. All the csv files contain information scrapped from websites.
- **CITY_POP.csv** : CSV file inside Data folder which contains population data of different cities.
- **DATABASE.csv** : CSV file inside Data folder which is the complete dataset created after scrapping 100 webpages (Shape : 100 rows x 17 columns). 
- **DEMO.csv** : CSV file inside Data folder which has a dataset with 2 entries and were used for code demonstration for the competition.
- **GDP_INFLATION.csv** : CSV file inside Data folder which has data of GDP & Inflation of different states & Union Territory.
- **LITERACY.csv** : CSV file inside Data folder which has data of literacy rate of different states & Union Territory.
- **NUMBER_OF_INCIDENTS.csv** : CSV file inside Data folder which has data of different terrorist incidents over the years.  
- **Images** : It contains image files that are used in Jupyter Notebooks for code understanding,visualizations and demonstration of the project.
- **CLASSIFICATION.ipynb** : It has code snippets of classification algorithms to classify **Anti-National** or **Non Anti-National** incidents. 
- **DATA_VISUALIZATION.ipynb** : It has visualizations which assists us in gaining insights and feature selection.
- **PREDICTION.ipynb** : It has code snippets of Random Forest Regressor & ARIMA model for final predictions.
- **PRE_PROCESSING.ipynb** : It has code snippets to create the database which is used throughout the project.

## What You Will Learn :
- Different preprocessing techniques.
- Understanding code snippets from different files.
- Use of Jupyter Notebooks for demonstration & presentation purposes.
- Modelling of Random Forest Regressor & ARIMA for predicting results.

Thank You!
